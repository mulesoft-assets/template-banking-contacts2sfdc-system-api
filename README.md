+ Mule ESB Configuration XML from External Location

You can find a detailed description on how to do so in this [Documentation Page](https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-studio/v/6/importing-and-exporting-in-studio).

### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule-<env>.properties`, in src/main/app/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application"`

### Running on Mule ESB stand alone <a name="runonmuleesbstandalone"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties](../master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`. 

### Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>
While [creating your application on CloudHub](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to `"Manage Application"` > `"Properties"` to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured**.
Follow other steps defined [here](#runonpremise) and once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else.
